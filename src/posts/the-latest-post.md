What makes Ethereum ***the*** Blockchain/Digital Asset Network? When you're at the top, you are the hunted, and we've seen several blockchains claim to be the "Ethereum Killer" the past few years. Maybe it's the Dapps, DeFi ecosystem, the Smart Contracts or the ERC20 Standard that fueled the ICO bubble? All those are a "part" of Ethereum's dominance for sure, but more than that, I'm of the opinion Ethereum ran away from the competition because they mastered "Network effects". Chainlink, Aave, and a few other Crypto Ecosystems are now following this same blueprint. So what exactly are the "Network effects" other Blockchains can't easily replicate? 

## 1. A "face" to lead the initial charge
Although Vitalik Buterin has openly expressed many times he doesn't want to be the "Face of Ethereum", the fact remains, he's exactly that. It's certainly not hurt the "branding" to have a young, very very itelligent, polite, humble guy to lead the way. For me personally, it plays a big part in my belief in Ethereum long term, as Vitalik seems very genuine, and if you ask other Ethereum folks, I bet many would say the same. The same holds true for strong brands like Chainlink with Sergey or Aave with Stan, they can build a loyal following.

## 2. Community
A strong loyal "decentralized" community takes time to build, so when you have it, it's invaluable. The ".eth handles", "link marines", "yield farmers" parading around "Crypto Twitter" isn't something other Networks can imitate or fake, like exchange volumes. People want to feel "connected", they want to be apart of something big, new, and innovative. Ethereum has mastered bringing the small parts of a system together, Devs, Dapps, Podcasters, Bloggers, Twitter evangelists, traders etc... all interact, in a decentralized ecosystem, that's easier said than done.

## 3. Developers and Companies fostering the "open source" mindset
The developers building on Ethereum are the best around. Guys like Austin Griffith at eth.build, Gitcoin and "Gitcoin grants", Kernal, Open Zepplin, Consensys and many others who consistently put out videos and articles on building things, you have to work hard "NOT" to learn and build on Ethereum. To people who want to learn, build and grow, the knowledge shared in the Ethereum Ecosystem is invaluable.

These 3 things are what I think puts Ethereum above other similiar Blockchains. Even with high gas prices and the urgent need to scale, the reasons above help balance out the good with the (temporarly)bad.
