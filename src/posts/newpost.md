## "WTF is a DAO?"

****Our "testnet DAO" is running on the Aragon Network, so I wanted to explain more on exactly "WTF" a DAO is.****
A DAO stands for a "Decentralized Autonomous Organization", everyone knows what an Organization is. Now lets break down the other two words to give you a better idea about what a "DAO" is.

> *Decentralized*-- In Decentralized systems, there is no single "centralized authority" that makes decisions on behalf of all the parties. Instead each party, also called a "peer", makes local *autonomous* decisions towards its individual goals which may possibly conflict with those of other peers.

> *Autonomous*-- "Autonomous Organizations" or institutions are independent or self-governing. Autonomous Organizations are responsible for finding sufficient resources or modifying their plans, programs, courses, responsibilities, and services accordingly.[4] In doing so, they must contend with any obstacles that can occur, such as social pressure against cut-backs or socioeconomic difficulties.

So in simpler terms, a DAO has no centralized authority it answers to, so it's self governing in all operations, meaning all "Members/Governance Token holders" have a "vote" in the operations and decisions of the DAO. With the rise of Crypto, Tokenization and the value placed on it, we're now seeing systems put in place to mesh the future of a more mobile society such as workforce decisions, voting, governance, and local decision making without having to "meet" in a physical place. Another exciting possibility is the ability to use the "DAO" on a local level to direct funding/vision toward a "majority" that isn't based solely on "Money, Politics, or Title". I don't know about you, I cant count the times I've seen important "decisions" being made by a "small group" for the entire community and most end up scratching their heads at the decisions. DAO's will go a long way in helping prevent those situations. 

Inclusion leads to better discussion, in the past, smaller community voices had no solutions to be heard, DAO systems will allow the best solution to be openly discussed, voted on and implemented. We're still very early in the "Decentralized", "Digital Asset" industry but DAO's offer promising solutions for the future.
